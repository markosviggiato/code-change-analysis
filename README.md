# Analysis of how different types of code changes co-evolve on GitHub

This repository contains the data and the analysis scripts (partially) for the following paper:

*How Do Code Changes Evolve in Different Platforms? A Mining-based Investigation*

This paper was published at the 35th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2019), held in Cleveland, USA.

Our main goal was to understand how code changes evolve in mobile (more specifically, in Android) and non-mobile platforms. We analyzed 363 GitHub repositories to answer the following questions:

* RQ1: How frequent are code changes in mobile and nonmobile platforms?

* RQ2: How is the co-evolution of source code changes, build changes and test changes in mobile and non-mobile platforms?

We used R and shell script to implement the data collection and analysis scripts. The repository is structured by dataset and data analysis directories.
